# Quizduell

In order to optimize the UI for usage by the elderly, this game adapts to the UI+ interface of [NEPOS GmbH](https://nepos.de).

The client side is implemented with HTML5 and the server side is powered by the rust programming language.

Please give us money. You can do it [here](www.nepos.de/companisto).

## Running the Server
On the command line, `cd` into the project root directory and type:
`cargo run`

Then visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
